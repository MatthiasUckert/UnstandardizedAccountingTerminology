## Abstract

The communication of accounting information requires a domain-specific vocabulary, and, in spe-cialized languages, standardization is considered a key to clear communication, i.e., one term should only be assigned to one concept and vice versa. In practice, accounting terminology is un-standardized and produces undue complexity. We provide the first large-sample evidence on the level and the implications of unstandardized accounting terminology for a global corpus of annual reports. Our study shows that unstandardized accounting terminology is widespread and has eco-nomic consequences, increasing human and computerized information processing costs.
