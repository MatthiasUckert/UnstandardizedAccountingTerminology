## Abstract

The communication of accounting information requires a domain-specific vocabulary, and in specialized languages, standardization is considered a key to clear communication, i.e., one term should only be assigned to one concept and vice versa. In practice, accounting terminology is unstandardized and produces undue complexity. We provide the first large-sample evidence on the level and the implications of unstandardized accounting terminology for a global corpus of annual reports. Our study shows that unstandardized accounting terminology is widespread and increases human and computerized information processing costs, i.e., has economic consequences.
