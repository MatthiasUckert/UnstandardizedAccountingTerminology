# Term Lists

To build a comprehensive thesaurus of accounting terminology, we construct two alternative accounting term and concept lists following **top-down** and **bottom-up** approaches.

## Methodology

**Top-Down Approach:** We collect accounting terms from multiple authoritative sourcesâ€”IFRS, US GAAP, UK GAAP standards, and specialized accounting dictionaries. Terms explicitly classified as synonyms are grouped by their underlying accounting concepts. The lists are refined using a GPT-based procedure and manually validated to ensure they reflect terminology actually used in practice across our global corpus.

**Bottom-Up Approach:** We leverage XBRL filings from EDGAR, extracting the different terms firms use to describe the same line item by mapping them to underlying accounting concepts via taxonomy tags. To reduce noise, we impose a frequency threshold (terms must appear in at least 20 distinct filings) and apply a majority disambiguation rule (removing terms appearing in less than 5% of filings for a given concept). This approach ensures we capture variation in real-world reporting practice.

## Term List (Data)

::: panel-tabset
### Top-Down Termlist

**Authoritative Sources Approach**

This list is constructed from IFRS, US GAAP, UK GAAP standards, and specialized accounting dictionaries. Terms are grouped by accounting concepts and refined through GPT-based processing and manual validation. The list is restricted to terminology observed in our global corpus, ensuring it reflects actual reporting practice.

**Key Characteristics:**

-   **Source:** Authoritative accounting standards and dictionaries
-   **Average synonyms per concept:** 5.4
-   **Textual similarity:** 0.78
-   **Concentration:** 0.58

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

create_interactive_table(
  .data = arrow::read_parquet("data/Termlists/TermListROW.parquet"),
  .page_length = 10L,
  .column_align = c("center", "center", "left"),
  .header_align = "center",
  .filter = "none",
  .font_size = 14L,
  .row_padding = 2L
)  
```

### Bottom-Up (10-K)

**XBRL-Based Approach: U.S. Domestic Filers**

This list is derived from XBRL filings (Form 10-K) on EDGAR. We extract terms firms use to label the same line items, mapping them to accounting concepts via taxonomy tags. Terms must appear in at least 20 distinct filings. This approach captures variation in real-world reporting practice for U.S. domestic filers.

**Key Characteristics:**

-   **Source:** \~50,000 U.S. 10-K XBRL filings
-   **Average synonyms per concept:** 12.0
-   **Textual similarity:** 0.86
-   **Concentration:** 0.54

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

create_interactive_table(
  .data = arrow::read_parquet("data/Termlists/TermList10K.parquet"),
  .page_length = 10L,
  .column_align = c("center", "center", "left"),
  .header_align = "center",
  .filter = "none",
  .font_size = 14L,
  .row_padding = 2L
)
```

### Bottom-Up (20-F)

**XBRL-Based Approach: International Filers**

This list follows the same methodology as the 10-K bottom-up approach but focuses on non-U.S. firms cross-listed in the United States that file Form 20-F using the IFRS Taxonomy. This allows us to capture terminology variation in international reporting practice.

**Key Characteristics:**

-   **Source:** 20-F XBRL filings (international filers using IFRS)
-   **Methodology:** Same as 10-K bottom-up approach
-   **Frequency threshold:** 20+ filings
-   **Disambiguation:** 5% threshold per concept

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

create_interactive_table(
  .data = arrow::read_parquet("data/Termlists/TermList20F.parquet"),
  .page_length = 10L,
  .column_align = c("center", "center", "left"),
  .header_align = "center",
  .filter = "none",
  .font_size = 14L,
  .row_padding = 2L
)
```
