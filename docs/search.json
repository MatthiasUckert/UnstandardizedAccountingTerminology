    "text": "Term Lists\nTo build a comprehensive thesaurus of accounting terminology, we construct two alternative accounting term and concept lists following top-down and bottom-up approaches.\n\nConstruction Methodology\nTop-Down Approach: We collect accounting terms from multiple authoritative sources—IFRS, US GAAP, UK GAAP standards, and specialized accounting dictionaries. Terms explicitly classified as synonyms are grouped by their underlying accounting concepts. The lists are refined using a GPT-based procedure and manually validated to ensure they reflect terminology actually used in practice across our global corpus.\nBottom-Up Approach: We leverage XBRL filings from EDGAR, extracting the different terms firms use to describe the same line item by mapping them to underlying accounting concepts via taxonomy tags. To reduce noise, we impose a frequency threshold (terms must appear in at least 20 distinct filings) and apply a majority disambiguation rule (removing terms appearing in less than 5% of filings for a given concept). This approach ensures we capture variation in real-world reporting practice.\n\n\nKey Differences\nThe bottom-up lists contain more terms and include higher n-gram terms (3+ words), reflecting the technical nature of XBRL taxonomies. On average, bottom-up concepts have more synonyms per concept (12.0 vs 5.4 for top-down), higher textual similarity (0.86 vs 0.78), and lower concentration (0.54 vs 0.58). This variation captures not only true synonyms but also different writing conventions used in practice.\n\nDownload all term lists in a formatted Excel file (with separate sheets for each dataset):\n📥 Download Term Lists (Excel, 2.6 MB)"

Terms explicitly classified as synonyms are grouped by their underlying concepts. All lists are refined using GPT-based validation and manual checks, then restricted to terminology actually observed in our global corpus of financial reports.\nBottom-Up (XBRL Filings): We extract terms directly from financial statements by parsing XBRL filings on EDGAR. Specifically, we use Exhibit 101.LAB files, which map XBRL taxonomy tags to the natural language labels firms actually use in their reports. This captures real-world variation in reporting practice. To reduce noise, we require that 10-K terms appear in at least 20 distinct filings and 20-F terms in at least 5 distinct filings.

    "text": "Overview\nWe construct alternative accounting dictionaries to capture the universe of accounting terminology and measure standardization in financial reporting. Each dictionary consists of two components:\n\nTerm Lists: Unique accounting terms that appear in financial reports\nConcept Lists: Granular mappings showing which terms are used to describe the same underlying accounting concepts (i.e., synonyms)\n\nTop-Down (Authoritative Sources): We collect terms from IFRS, US GAAP, and UK GAAP standards, plus specialized accounting dictionaries and the EU’s IATE database. Terms explicitly classified as synonyms are grouped by their underlying concepts. All lists are refined using GPT-based validation and manual checks, then restricted to terminology actually observed in our global corpus of financial reports.\nBottom-Up (XBRL Filings): We extract terms directly from financial statements by parsing XBRL filings on EDGAR. Specifically, we use Exhibit 101.LAB files, which map XBRL taxonomy tags to the natural language labels firms actually use in their reports. This captures real-world variation in reporting practice. To reduce noise, we require that 10-K terms appear in at least 20 distinct filings and 20-F terms in at least 5 distinct filings. We apply a majority disambiguation rule, removing terms that appear in less than 5% of filings for a given concept.\n\n\nTerm Lists\nDownload all term lists: 📥 Excel File (2.6 MB)\n\nTop-DownBottom-Up (10-K)Bottom-Up (20-F)\n\n\nSource: IFRS, US GAAP, UK GAAP standards, and specialized accounting dictionaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ~50,000 U.S. 10-K XBRL filings (2009-2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: 20-F XBRL filings from non-U.S. firms using IFRS Taxonomy (2009-2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept Lists\nDownload all concept lists: 📥 Excel File\n\nTop-DownBottom-Up (10-K)Bottom-Up (20-F)\n\n\nConstruction: Terms from dictionaries and standards explicitly classified as synonyms are grouped into concepts. Concepts are validated using graph theory (complete graph property) and GPT-based checks to ensure all terms within a concept are truly interchangeable.\nStructure: Each row shows a term (TID) and its associated concept (CID), along with the n-gram count.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction: Terms are grouped by XBRL taxonomy tags, where each tag represents a distinct accounting concept. Terms linked to multiple tags are assigned to their primary concept using a majority rule (5% threshold).\nStructure: Each row shows which term (TID) maps to which XBRL concept (CID). This reveals how U.S. domestic filers describe the same accounting items using different terminology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction: Same methodology as 10-K, but using IFRS Taxonomy tags from 20-F filings. Captures how international filers describe accounting concepts.\nStructure: Each row shows term-concept mappings based on IFRS Taxonomy, revealing cross-border variation in financial reporting language."

The function aims to find corresponding names in the target table for each name in the source table.\n.fstd: Standardization Function - This is a user-defined or built-in function used to standardize the names in both source and target tables. By default, the function uses the built-in standardize_str function for this purpose.\n.dir: Data Storage Directory - This parameter specifies the directory where the processed data will be stored, allowing for easy access and review of the intermediate data files.\n.return: Return Tables as List - This is a boolean flag that determines whether the processed source and target tables should be returned as a list. If set to TRUE, the function will return the tables; otherwise, it will only store them in the specified directory.\n.verbose: Verbose Output - This boolean flag controls the display of additional information during the function’s execution.

It enables easy access and review of the intermediate data files created during the matching process.\n.cols Named Vector for Columns - This parameter is a named vector containing the columns to be considered for matching. The names in the vector should be either “e” or “exact” for an exact comparison of the strings, or “f” or “fuzzy” for a fuzzy matching approach as specified by the .method argument. Names in the vector can be either quoted or unquoted, while the values must be quoted.\n.range Character Range - This parameter defines the range of characters to be considered when matching names. For example, if a name in the source table has 10 characters and .range is set to 5, any name within the 5-15 character range in the target table will be considered for matching.\n.weights Column Weights - This named vector assigns weights to each column used for matching. If not specified, all columns will be assigned equal weights by default.\n.max_match Maximum Matches - This parameter determines the maximum number of matches to be returned for each record in the source table.\n.allow_mult Multiple Match Permission - This boolean parameter indicates whether multiple matches are allowed for each record in the target table. If you want a 1-1 match, set it to FALSE; for a 1-n match, set it to TRUE.\n.method Matching Method - This parameter specifies the method to be used for matching records. It can be one of the following: “osa”, “lv”, “dl”, “hamming”, “lcs”, “qgram”, “cosine”, “jaccard”, “jw”, or “soundex”. For more information on these methods, refer to the stringdist-metrics documentation in the {stringdist} package.\n.workers Parallel Workers - This parameter defines the number of workers to be used for parallelization during the matching process.\n.mat_size Maximum Matrix Size - This parameter sets the maximum size of the similarity matrix created during the fuzzy matching process. If you are dealing with a large number of names to match, the matrix can become very large. Adjust this value to avoid overloading your system’s memory.\n.verbose Verbose Output - This boolean flag determines whether additional information is displayed during the execution of the function.

    "text": "Overview\nWe construct alternative accounting dictionaries to capture the universe of accounting terminology and measure standardization in financial reporting. Each dictionary consists of two components:\n\nTerm Lists: Unique accounting terms that appear in financial reports\nConcept Lists: Granular mappings showing which terms are used to describe the same underlying accounting concepts (i.e., synonyms)\n\nTop-Down (Authoritative Sources): We collect terms from IFRS, US GAAP, and UK GAAP standards, plus specialized accounting dictionaries and the EU’s IATE database. Terms explicitly classified as synonyms are grouped by their underlying concepts. All lists are refined using GPT-based validation and manual checks, then restricted to terminology actually observed in our global corpus of financial reports.\nBottom-Up (XBRL Filings): We extract terms directly from financial statements by parsing XBRL filings on EDGAR. Specifically, we use Exhibit 101.LAB files, which map XBRL taxonomy tags to the natural language labels firms actually use in their reports. This captures real-world variation in reporting practice. To reduce noise, we require that 10-K terms appear in at least 20 distinct filings and 20-F terms in at least 5 distinct filings. We apply a majority disambiguation rule, removing terms that appear in less than 5% of filings for a given concept.\n\n\nTerm Lists\nDownload all term lists: 📥 Excel File (2.6 MB)\n\nTop-DownBottom-Up (10-Ks)Bottom-Up (20-Fs)\n\n\nSource: IFRS, US GAAP, UK GAAP standards, and specialized accounting dictionaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ~50,000 U.S. 10-K XBRL filings (2009-2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: 20-F XBRL filings from non-U.S. firms using IFRS Taxonomy (2009-2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept Lists\nDownload all concept lists: 📥 Excel File\n\nTop-DownBottom-Up (10-Ks)Bottom-Up (20-Fs)\n\n\nConstruction: Terms from dictionaries and standards explicitly classified as synonyms are grouped into concepts. Concepts are validated using graph theory (complete graph property) and GPT-based checks to ensure all terms within a concept are truly interchangeable.\nStructure: Each row shows a term (TID) and its associated concept (CID), along with the n-gram count.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction: Terms are grouped by XBRL taxonomy tags, where each tag represents a distinct accounting concept. Terms linked to multiple tags are assigned to their primary concept using a majority rule (5% threshold).\nStructure: Each row shows which term (TID) maps to which XBRL concept (CID). This reveals how U.S. domestic filers describe the same accounting items using different terminology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction: Same methodology as 10-K, but using IFRS Taxonomy tags from 20-F filings. Captures how international filers describe accounting concepts.\nStructure: Each row shows term-concept mappings based on IFRS Taxonomy, revealing cross-border variation in financial reporting language."
