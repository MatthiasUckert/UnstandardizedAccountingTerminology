    "text": "Term Lists\nTo build a comprehensive thesaurus of accounting terminology, we construct two alternative accounting term and concept lists following top-down and bottom-up approaches.\n\nConstruction Methodology\nTop-Down Approach: We collect accounting terms from multiple authoritative sources—IFRS, US GAAP, UK GAAP standards, and specialized accounting dictionaries. Terms explicitly classified as synonyms are grouped by their underlying accounting concepts. The lists are refined using a GPT-based procedure and manually validated to ensure they reflect terminology actually used in practice across our global corpus.\nBottom-Up Approach: We leverage XBRL filings from EDGAR, extracting the different terms firms use to describe the same line item by mapping them to underlying accounting concepts via taxonomy tags. To reduce noise, we impose a frequency threshold (terms must appear in at least 20 distinct filings) and apply a majority disambiguation rule (removing terms appearing in less than 5% of filings for a given concept). This approach ensures we capture variation in real-world reporting practice.\n\n\nKey Differences\nThe bottom-up lists contain more terms and include higher n-gram terms (3+ words), reflecting the technical nature of XBRL taxonomies. On average, bottom-up concepts have more synonyms per concept (12.0 vs 5.4 for top-down), higher textual similarity (0.86 vs 0.78), and lower concentration (0.54 vs 0.58). This variation captures not only true synonyms but also different writing conventions used in practice.\n\nDownload all term lists in a formatted Excel file (with separate sheets for each dataset):\n📥 Download Term Lists (Excel, 2.6 MB)"

Terms explicitly classified as synonyms are grouped by their underlying concepts. All lists are refined using GPT-based validation and manual checks, then restricted to terminology actually observed in our global corpus of financial reports.\nBottom-Up (XBRL Filings): We extract terms directly from financial statements by parsing XBRL filings on EDGAR. Specifically, we use Exhibit 101.LAB files, which map XBRL taxonomy tags to the natural language labels firms actually use in their reports. This captures real-world variation in reporting practice. To reduce noise, we require that 10-K terms appear in at least 20 distinct filings and 20-F terms in at least 5 distinct filings.

    "text": "Construction Approaches\nTop-Down (Authoritative Sources): We collect terms from IFRS, US GAAP, and UK GAAP standards, plus specialized accounting dictionaries and the EU’s IATE database. Terms explicitly classified as synonyms are grouped by their underlying concepts. All lists are refined using GPT-based validation and manual checks, then restricted to terminology actually observed in our global corpus of financial reports.\nBottom-Up (XBRL Filings): We extract terms directly from financial statements by parsing XBRL filings on EDGAR. Specifically, we use Exhibit 101.LAB files, which map XBRL taxonomy tags to the natural language labels firms actually use in their reports. This captures real-world variation in reporting practice. To reduce noise, we require that 10-K terms appear in at least 20 distinct filings and 20-F terms in at least 5 distinct filings. We apply a majority disambiguation rule, removing terms that appear in less than 5% of filings for a given concept."

The higher textual similarity (0.86 vs 0.78) reflects that XBRL-based terms often share common structure from taxonomy labels, while lower concentration (0.54 vs 0.58) indicates that term usage is more evenly distributed rather than dominated by a few common terms."
